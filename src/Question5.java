/*
 Create three classes: Village, Citizen, and ComputeIntellect.
The Village class has an instance variable called numberOfCitizens and an array that holds a
maximum of 100 Citizen objects.
The Citizen class has citizenId and educationalQualification as instance variables.
The ComputeIntellect class has a distributionOfQualification() method.
Create 100 Citizen objects using citizenId for the range [1 to 100]. Randomly generate the
educational qualification in the range [1 to 4], where 1 = high school, 2 = undergraduate, 3 =
postgraduate, and 4 = doctorate.
Store these 100 objects in a Village object using an array â€“ any array of your choice.
The distributionOfQualification() method loops through the 100 objects and counts the
number of citizens corresponding to each of the four educational qualifications.
